Here are some steps to take:</p> <ol> <li>Quickly search the existing issues using relevant keywords to ensure your issue hasn't been addressed already.</li> <li> <p>If your issue is not listed, create a new one. Try to be as detailed and clear as possible in your description.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you're merely suggesting an improvement or reporting a bug, that's already excellent! We thank you for it. Your issue will be listed and, hopefully, addressed at some point.</p> </li> <li>However, if you're willing to be the one solving the issue, that would be even better!
